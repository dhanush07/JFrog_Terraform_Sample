## Releases

Current provider major release: **12.x**

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full details

## Versions

Version 6.x is compatible with the Artifactory versions 7.49.x and below.

Version 7.x and 8.x is only compatible with Artifactory between 7.50.x and 7.67.x due to changes in the projects functionality.

Version 10.x (and later) is compatible with latest Artifactory versions (>=7.68.7 (self-hosted) and >=7.67.0 (cloud)).

## Terraform CLI version support

Current version support [Terraform Protocol v6](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/terraform-plugin-protocol#protocol-version-6) which mean Terraform CLI version 1.0 and later. 

## Quick Start

Create a new Terraform file with `artifactory` resources. Also see [sample.tf](./sample.tf):

### HCL Example

```terraform
# Required for Terraform 1.0 and up (https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides)
terraform {
  required_providers {
    artifactory = {
      source  = "jfrog/artifactory"
      version = "12.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "artifactory" {
  // supply JFROG_ACCESS_TOKEN, and JFROG_URL as env vars
}

resource "artifactory_local_pypi_repository" "pypi-local" {
  key         = "pypi-local"
  description = "Repo created by Terraform Provider Artifactory"
}

resource "artifactory_artifact_webhook" "artifact-webhook" {
  key         = "artifact-webhook"
  event_types = ["deployed", "deleted", "moved", "copied"]
  criteria {
    any_local        = true
    any_remote       = false
    repo_keys        = [artifactory_local_pypi_repository.pypi-local.key]
    include_patterns = ["foo/**"]
    exclude_patterns = ["bar/**"]
  }
  url    = "http://tempurl.org/webhook"
  secret = "some-secret"
  proxy  = "proxy-key"

  custom_http_headers = {
    header-1 = "value-1"
    header-2 = "value-2"
  }

  depends_on = [artifactory_local_pypi_repository.pypi-local]
}
```
